        <h2>Mission Statement</h2>
        <p align="left">Our mission is to promote awareness,
            understanding, and harmony internally, interpersonally, culturally,
            ecologically and ideologically.</p>
        <p>Enso Center encourages the growth of strong<br />
            sustainable communities through the study of <br />
            martial arts,nature,languages, literacy, <br />
            communication, and fine arts.</p>
        <h4>Internally</h4>
        <p><img src="images_layout/about_enso01.jpg" alt="" align="right" height="87" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="125" /> Enso Center focuses on integrating internal
            arts into daily practice and basic teaching curricula, building
            positive discipline lifestyles, and providing practical learning
            experiences. We aspire to balance body and mind through training and
            development. We aim to hone mental and physical self-discipline, to
            inspire personal development, to challenge creativity, to promote
            academic excellence, and increase appreciation of civil society and
            healthy lifestyles.</p>
        <h4>Interpersonally</h4>
        <p>Enso Center developed as a non-profit, non-sectarian,
            grassroots, educational organization dedicated to building strong,
            sustainable communities by teaching peacekeeping skills through the
            study of martial arts, nature, languages, technology, communication,
            and literacy. We are committed to teaching the art of peace through
            self-control, self-defense, compassion, respect for all, and conflict
            resolution. We utilize pro-active, communicative approaches that
            empower individuals and bind communities together.</p>
        <h4>Culturally</h4>
        <p>Enso Center is committed to the support, promotion,
            documentation, and teaching of living arts, and to the preservation of
            their common, fundamental lifeline-the "living treasure" of direct
            teacher to student transmission within a disciplined life. We believe
            that in order to learn more about peace, nature, community, and the
            world, one must study, practice, and manifest a commitment to them in
            daily life. We build new bridges and cross disciplinary connections to
            create an association of families, artists, students, and teachers
            dedicated to healthy and safe communities-communities that value human
            rights, community service, diversity, and pluralism.</p>
        <h4>Ecologically</h4>
        <p>Enso Center exists in the larger communities of nature and
            human societies. We believe in the enhancement and enrichment of these
            communities through recognizing mutual dependence, building greater
            understanding, and encouraging meaningful and productive partnership.</p>
        <h4>Ideologically</h4>
        <p>Enso Center is devoted to teaching the principles of
            compassion and peaceful resolution of conflict through artistic
            disciplines. Our unique educational programs utilize cross-cultural
            communication and conflict management strategies â emphasizing fun,
            learning, creativity, and tolerance.</p>
        <p>Enso Center extends to all students, regardless of race,
            color, gender, sexual orientation, religion, national or ethnic origin,
            the rights, privileges, programs, and activities generally accorded or
            made available to its students. We do not discriminate in the
            administration of educational policies, scholarship and loan programs,
            or other athletic or school administered programs.</p>

            <p>Enso Center Tuition rates are published on the <a href="http://ensocenter.org/tuition.html">Tuition Page</a>.</p>
            <p>Tuition is paid monthly.</p>
            <p>There is an annual individual or family administration
                fee. This fee is tax deductible.<br />
                There is a promotion fee for each belt level test. This fee is also tax deductible.<br />
                If you want to be certified through World Hapkido Federation at the
                black belt level there is a separate fee for that as they are our
                parent organization.<br />
            </p>
            <p>AUTORENEW is Enso Centerâs <strong>preferred</strong>
                method of payment. </p>
            <p>We are <strong>strongly</strong>
                encouraging all of our students (or their parents) to use this method
                when paying for monthly tuition and the annual registration fee. It
                gives you the best rate and is the most convenient for you and for Enso
                Center.</p>
            <p>You may cancel AUTORENEW at any time by giving notice
                before your next payment.</p>

                Currently you can choose between a Middle Weight and a Heavy Weight

        <blockquote>
            <p>The length of time between promotions will vary

                required curriculum for each level.&nbsp; </p>
            <p>One of the things that we recognize at Enso Center is
                that people progress at their own speed. Having said that, most people
                promote on average every two to six months at the lower colored belt
                levels. </p>
            <p>As your rank increases, so do the requirements and
                expectations and consequently the time between promotion tests will be
                longer.&nbsp; </p>
            <p>A key factor in the time taken is your diligence in
                practice and how often you are able to attend class.</p>
